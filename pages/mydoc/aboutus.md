GDG Cloud Hanoi is inspired by GDG Global. We started our journey in June 2019. We try to engage student developers, fresh graduates and professionals through our hack events & meetups. The motive is to create a local ecosystem of programmers & hackers in and around Hanoi. The technology awareness is main goal for first few years of the group.
