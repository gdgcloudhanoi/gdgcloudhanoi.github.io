**GDG Cloud Hanoi** is inspired by [GDG Global](https://developers.google.com/community/gdg/). **We started our journey in June 2019**. 

We try to engage student developers, fresh graduates and professionals through our hack events & meetups. 
GDG Cloud Hanoi is dedicated to building a strong community for GCP users in Hanoi.

> GDGs are local groups of developers who are specifically interested in Google products and APIs. Each local group is called a GDG chapter and can host a variety of technical activities for developers - from just a few people getting together to watch our latest videos, to large gatherings with demos and tech talks, to hackathons.
